# Numerical Methods for Linear Algebra

Computer Science implementations for the book "Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction" from David Poole.

I did this for the course *Modelagem Matemática 3: Sistemas Lineares e Otimização* (Linear Systems and Optimization)
at the Escola de Mamemática Aplicada (EMAp). The course was led by Professor Antonio Branco.

Date: 2017.1

Implementations:

* Jacobi's iterative method to solve linear systems

* Gauss-Seidel's iterative method to solve linear systems

* Least Square Method

* Single Value Decomposition and Rotation with Lena's classical image from the Playboy maganzine.

* Iterative methods to find the eigen-values and eigen-vectors: power method, shifted power method, inverse power method, inverse shifted power method.
