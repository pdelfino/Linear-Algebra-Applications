# Linear Algebra Applications

Computer Science implementations for the book "Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction" from David Poole.

I did this for the course "Modelagem Matemática 3: Sistemas Lineares e Otimização" at the Escola de Mamemática Aplicada (EMAp). The course was led by Professor Antonio Branco.

Implementations:

1 - Jacobi's iterative method to solve linear systems

2- Gauss-Seidel's iterative method to solve linear systems

3 - Least Square Method

4 - Single Value Decomposition and Rotation with Lena's classical image from the Playboy maganzine.

5- Iterative methods to find the eigen-values and eigen-vectors: power method, shifted power method, inverse power method, inverse shifted power method.
