# Linear Algebra Applications

Computer Science implementations for the book "Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction" from David Poole.

I did this for the course "Modelagem Matemática 3: Sistemas Lineares e Otimização" at the Escola de Mamemática Aplicada (EMAp). The course was led by Professor Antonio Branco.
